- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sophia @KZ0PHA
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m new to GitHub. I love learning new skills and am currently studying towards the APICS CSCP (Supply Chain Management Certification). 
- ðŸŒ± Right now I'm trying to learn all the basics in programming and hopefully I'll start learning JavaScript in the near future.
